- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations for all entities

### Day 5-7: GUI Foundation and Authentication

- [ ] Choose GUI framework (Swing recommended for simplicity)
- [ ] Create main application window and navigation system
- [ ] Implement login screen with user authentication
- [ ] Create role-based access control (Admin vs Staff)
- [ ] Build main dashboard with role-specific menus
- [ ] Implement logout functionality

## Risk Mitigation for 2-Week Timeline

### Time Management

- **Focus on Core Requirements**: Prioritize essential features over nice-to-have features
- **Simple GUI Design**: Use basic Swing components, avoid complex custom styling
- **Minimal Documentation**: Focus on code quality, document only essential parts
- **Basic Testing**: Test core functionality, skip comprehensive testing

### Technical Simplifications

- **Simple Authentication**: Basic password hashing, no complex security features
- **Basic Reports**: Simple text-based reports, no charts or complex analytics
- **Minimal Error Handling**: Focus on preventing crashes, basic user feedback
- **No Advanced Features**: Skip backup, import/export, email notifications

### Quality vs Speed Trade-offs

- **Code Quality**: Maintain clean, readable code structure
- **Functionality**: Ensure all required features work correctly
- **User Experience**: Basic but functional interface
- **Documentation**: Essential documentation only
